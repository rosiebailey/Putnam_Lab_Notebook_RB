### <center> Settlement Substrate Protocol </center>

This post includes the current protocol for creating substrate for settlement as well as the troubleshooting process that led to this current protocol.


## Troubleshooting and previous methods

# First issue - Substrate Type
*Note that there is a noticeable difference between settlement rates on waterproof paper and cover slips*
We had originally tried using cover slips as settlement but they proved difficult to remove, an method that was attempted to help this issue was the addition of  red tape to pick up the cover slips. This proved difficult for viewing the settlement progress.
#Solution -
We decided to begin using waterproof paper as well as using white tape in order to aide the observation process.
# Second issue - Removing substrate from well-plates
The first attempt of creating settlement substrate with waterproof paper proved difficult to remove the substrate from the well plates. Initially they did not have folded tabs. We also began taping the corner of the cover slip rather than having it on half of the cover slip.  
# Solution -
The addition of tape tabs on the corner of cover slips and folded corner tabs on the water proof paper eased the process of removing the substrate for observation.

# Third issue - Settlement on well plate vs. Substrate
The ratio of micro-propagules settling on the bottom of the well plate to settling on the substrate proved that there was an issue with the size of the waterproof proof paper. Two options were created as a solution.
# Solutions -
  1. Shown in the image below is the green size guide for the substrate paper that will fit in the bottom of the well plate with one corner folded for a tab.

  2. Shown in the image below are the different shape options that were also attempted. There are half-circles and squares. There has been no observable difference in settlement rates between the two substrate shapes.
  *Note that the option for a complete circle was considered but not proceeded with because it would have proven difficult to remove the substrate and view the micro-propagules with that shape.*

  *Note: these substrates have half plain substrate and half crushed plug substrate.*

# Fourth issue - Substrate type vs. Settlement
There was an issue with the amount of micro-propagules settling on the substrate compared to the amount floating in the water column.
# Solution -
We decided that crushing a few settlement plugs into a fine powder and gluing the powder onto the substrate types could help the micro-propagules settle on the substrate rather than remain floating in the water column.
We also are using half cover slips and half waterproof paper (cut into different shapes) in order to continue observing if there is a difference in settlement rates between the two substrate types.

## Current protocol
# Plain substrate process with sizing protocol
*Note that 60 squares, 30 0f each type (waterproof paper and coverslips), is enough for 10 full well plates.*

This is the current process in which the settlement substrate is made.

1. Gather the crushed plugs, cover slips, and water proof paper in the middle drawer labelled **Settlement Substrate Materials**.
2. The scissors and small Sharpies can be found in the drawer above the substrate materials.
3. Begin cutting squares of waterproof paper the size of the green size guide that can be found in the image above.
4. Have an empty and clean well plate ready for size reference.
5. After cutting the paper and folding a corner for a tab, ensure it fits into the well plate.
6. Take white tape and cut a length into small pieces that are about 05.-1 cm long. This length is enough to cover the corner of one coverslip and make a decent tab.
7. Place the tape on the edge of one side and carefully fold it to the other side so that it sticks to itself.
8. Place the cover slips in the well plates to ensure they will fit properly. (If the tab is too big, use the scissors to cut it).
9. Once all of the substrates have been cut and folded or taped, you can use the ruler that is in the bottom drawer (under the settlement substrate drawer) to measure 1 cm lines.
10. Draw two perpendicular lines on each waterproof paper square that are of 1 cm length.
11. Marking the lines on the coverslip may have to be done with the bigger Sharpies in order to get the ink to stick.
12. These substrate are now ready for settlement trials.

# Crushed-Plug process
Using the prepared substrate made in the "Plain substrate process", you can begin making half settlement plug and half plain substrate material.
1. Begin by taking out the crushed plugs, they should be in the square container with the blue lid in the **Settlement Substrate Materials** drawer.
2. The coral-safe glue (purple tube) can be found in the purple box in the top drawer underneath the lab bench.
*Make sure to wear gloves before gluing substrate.*
3. Begin gluing a small section that is about half of the substrate square/circle. The best method is to squeeze a pinhead size blob of glue out and then spread it with the glue tube tip.
4. You can get the crushed plug onto the substrate in multiple ways, the best methods include.
    - Dipping the substrate into the square container.
    - Placing substrate on a Kimwipe and dropping a pinch of crushed plug on top of the substrate. The excess crushed plug can be put back into the container by picking up the Kimwipe and pouring the pieces back into the container through the fold in the Kimwipe.
5. Make sure to tap off any excess crushed plug bits back into the container after 30 seconds, to allow the glue to become tacky and the pieces to properly adhere to the substrate.
6. When the crushed plug bits are low, using the dipping method is easier. You can tip the crushed bits to one side, place the piece of substrate on the other side, and then tip the container to have the powdery bits cover the glued section.

# Making plug powder
1. Take the settlement plugs from the **Settlement Substrate Materials** drawer.
2. Place one or two in a Ziplock bag.
3. Use a hammer, paint scraper handle, or wrench to begin smashing the plug to a fine powder. (This process utilizes any tool that is found in a persons near vicinity).
4. Continue smashing the plug until there are only small pieces and fine powder left in the bag.
*Note: the smaller the plug pieces, the easier it is to stick to substrate.*
