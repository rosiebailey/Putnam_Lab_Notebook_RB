### <center> Water-Quality-Test-Protocol </center>

This is the comparison between both the test protocols in The Wet Lab Manual and The CBLS Aquarium Room Water Quality Schedule and Protocols post by hgreich.
When comparing the two sets of protocols, both are similar and correct. The individual water tests with step-by-step instructions can be found further down in this document and in the Aquarium Room Protocols Post.
Consult the Wet Lab for PPE and Safety Protocols.
One big difference between the two sets of protocols is the water retrieval site, the Wet Lab instructs to pull water from the header tank and the Aquarium Room Protocol does not specify where the water should be tested from.

## General-Water-Test-Notes
- Before beginning the water quality tests, be sure to obtain the waste bottles under the titration station from Lab room 190 in CBLS. Once conducted tests are finished, their waste and their rinse water can be dumped into respective 500 mL waste bottles.
- Make sure to wear appropriate PPE (gloves and protective eye glasses/ goggles) while performing all tests.
- **Do not put any test tubes into the water tanks** gather the water for testing with a clean container.  
- If tests have been contaminated or too much reagent is added, dump test into designated waste container, rinse with DI water, dump the rinse in the same waste container, and restart the test.
- When analyzing results, use the correct tables i.e. use the salt water table for reference when conducting the phosphate (PO4) test.
- **Rinse each test tube 3 times with DI Water** then dry with clean paper towel and place capped tube in respective box.
- Each test tube has it's own box **Do not mix test tubes**.
- Clearly record the data in the shared lab notebook with the date and your initials at the top of the page.
- Be sure to clean the lab space with a Clorox wipe before and after use to ensure cleanliness for all lab members.
- If you've used towels to dry any areas, rinse them in the sink and place them in under the water table on the black rack to dry.

## <left> Equipment-Protocol </left>

- There are tests when equipment is inserted into the tank. This equipment includes, but is not limited to, the pH probe, the Salinity probe, the Light probe, the thermometer probe. **Before any equipment is placed into the tanks they need to be cleaned with DI water and a kimwipe**.
- All equipment needs to be rinsed or wiped with kimwipe with **70% ethanol** solution and then with **DI water** to prevent salt erosion and ensure general lab cleanliness.
- **Do not put ethanol on the Salinity or pH probes** They are sensitive and expensive, DI Water rinse will be enough.
- Ensure the Salinity and pH probe tips are placed in their respective solution bottles.

## <left> Test-Steps </left>

*Note: These steps and data analysis charts can be found in the boxes with the test materials.*
*Note: All of the tests start with 5mL of the tank water.*
*Note: For all of the drops, hold bottles completely vertical to ensure one drop goes into the mixture at a time. This also standardizes the drop sizes.*

## <left> General-Probe-Care <left/>
- **Do not leave hand held probes out of their designated liquid bottles**

# Calibration-Notes
- **The handheld pH and salinity probes, apex pH, and salinity probes need to be calibrated every few days**.
It is best to do this *at least* **every 3 days**. Both meter probes (used for daily discrete measurements) and APEX probes must be calibrated every three days with corresponding solutions (Apex uses solutions from Neptune Systems - handheld Mettler Toledo (pH) and Thermoscience (conductivity) probes use buffers from TA and probe-specific solutions, respectively).
	- Update your notebook with the date and time of calibration.

# After-Use-Notes
After each use, follow these steps:
- Do not wipe probes with ethanol.
- Rinse all probes with DI Water and store them in dry area.
- Wipe off meter boxes with a kimwipe and 70% ethanol to remove excess salt and water.

# Light
*Note: Make sure that there is no shadow from fingers or probe handle covering the translucent part of the probe*.
1. Get the light probe from near the microscope and **take the blue cap off**. Place cap next to lab notebook to ensure it doesn't get lost.
2. Wipe wire and metal with DI water and a kimwipe.
3. Turn on meter box by pressing top left power button.
4. Place the metal part in the water at the same depth of the egg crate. **Making sure the translucent side is facing up**.
5. Look at the grey box for the measurement, take **5** measurments going in a line across the bottom of the water tank.
6. Measure the light both with plexiglass and no plexiglass on top of the tank.
7.  Record the numbers in the lab notebook **units in umol/m2/s** and take the average of the values without plexiglass.
8. Turn off probe and begin After use notes. [See above](#After-Use-Notes).

# pH
*You will have to do the tris-calibration process every three days to a week. Steps included below*
*Note: Make sure the meter box is measuring in mV, hitting the mode button will allow you to switch the units*
1. Press the power button (top left) to turn the probe on.
2. Rinse the tip of the probe with DI water and set aside the liquid bottle the tip was in.
3. Toggle the "channel" button (F3) to make sure you are viewing pH in mV.
4. Submerge the tip of the probe in the water table (near the Putnam Lab banner).
5. When the probe settles (will say "ready") record the pH **units in mV** in the lab notebook.
6. *Repeat steps 4 & 5 for the second water table, glass tank in water table 2, and the header tank (big black bucket).*
 7. Press the power button to turn the probe off and complete the after-use process [See above](#After-Use-Notes).

# Tris-Calibration
The goal of the Tris calibration is to measure pH (mV) across a range of temperatures lower and higher than currently experienced in the tanks. The temperature values and corresponding pH values must have a linear relationship and an R^2 value equal to or above 0.98 in order to calculate the pH values for the daily measurements from the calibration curve.

*Note: Measured with Orion Star A325 Thermoscientific pH/ conductivity meter and Mettler Toledo probe 51343101 and Control Company Certified traceable Temperature probe.*

1. Fill a small clean container (preferably a falcon tube) with certified Tris standard solution from the Dickson Lab.
2. After opening a new bottle, write "Opened", the date is yyyymmdd from , your initials and Putnam Lab - e.g., "RB - Putnam Lab".
3. Fill a plastic 1L container half way with ice. Set the Tris solution container on ice to cool the solution down to desired temperature **(~20C)**. This value will change based on the range of temperature you expect to be measuring. This will change through time in an experiment where temperature is not held constant.
4. With the certified temperature probe, measure the Tris solution temperature. Swirl the temperature probe in the solution as it measures to ensure the solution is well mixed.
5. With the Thermo A325 meter with the Mettler Toledo pH probe attached, click "Measure" on the meter when the Tris solution is nearing the first temperature (e.g., 25°C). Swirl the pH probe in the solution as it measures to ensure the solution is well mixed.
6. Wait for the temperature and mV value to stabilize and record values.
7. Warm the Tris Buffer by gently holding the outside of the tube/container. But be careful to not hold the container for too long or too aggressively, otherwise the temperature will spike without the chance to record values across the temperature range.
8. Make temperature and pH measurements across the desired range, with increments of about 0.4°C. Read the temperature value as soon as the pH meter states "ready" instead of "stabilizing".
9. Save measured values a new CSV file named today's date (yyyymmdd.csv) and save to "pH_Calibration_Files" folder. Column 1: mVTris (pH values); Column 2: Tris (temperature values).
10. Run the R Script titled "pH_Tris_Curve.R" on RStudio. Check the R^2 value and do not move on until the R^2 is equal to or above 0.98.
- **Remember: to run the R script, you need to:**
- **Make sure the Tris file was saved as a .csv**
- **Make sure that the data in the excel sheet is correct and the signs (+/-) are also correct.**
- **Check that the directory is set to where the Tris file (yyyymmdd.csv) is.**
- **Change the date in the R code to the date/name (since the name of the file is just the date) of the Tris file you are trying to run.**

# Salinity
*Note: Salinity and pH can be measured at the same time with the same machine (via different plug terminals) or separately.*
1. The Orion Star A325 Thermoscientific pH/ conductivity meter is ear the white bin. The Thermo Orion 013005MD conductivity (salinity) probe is stored in DI water.
2. Press the power button to turn the probe on
3. Toggle the "channel" button (F3) to make sure you are viewing salinity (conductivity) in psu
4. Place the probe in the water table (near the Putnam Lab banner). Make sure the whole conductivity cell is submerged in the water.
5. When the probe settles (will say "ready") record the salinity in the lab notebook
6. *Repeat steps 4 & 5 for the second water table, glass tank in water table 2, and the header tank (big black bucket)*.
7. Record all temperature measurements **Units in psu** in the lab notebook. Press the "mode" button to reset as necessary.
8. Press the power button to turn the probe off and complete the after-use process. [See above](#After-Use-Notes).

# Temperature
*Note: Temperature probe can and should be stored completely dry.*
1. The temperature probe - Traceable 4000 Thermometer S/N 170318187 is near the microscope.
2. Wipe off the metal portion of the probe with DI water using a kimwipe
3. Press the "ON/OFF" button (top left) to turn the probe on.
4. Place the metal portion of the probe in the water table (near the Putnam Lab banner).
5. When the probe settles within 0.1C, record the temperature in the lab notebook
6. *Repeat steps 4 & 5 for the second water table, glass tank in water table 2, and the header tank (big black bucket)*.
7. Record all temperature measurements **Units in Celsius** in the lab notebook. Press the F/C button to reset as necessary.
8. Press the "ON/OFF" button to turn the probe off and complete the after-use process. [See above](#After-Use-Notes).


### <left> Regulating-Water-Flow </left>

*Note: The flow of water is off when the blue valve handle is perpendicular to the pipe.*

*Note: The flow of water is on when the blue valve handle is parallel  to the pipe.*

*Note: If valves are turned to open flow between the tanks and the power source to the pump is off, the tank with the higher water volume will flow into the tank with the lower water volume until the equalize.*

If this scenario happens: *Be sure to check salinities of all tanks.*

**The salinity in the salt water mixing tank should never be less than that of the water tables or header tank.**

- The DI water tank should have a conductivity of 0.
- Average salinity in Salt water tank should be 34-35 ppt.
- The deviance between salinity values in tanks is okay up to 1ppt, but is ideally 0 ppt.

*If there are problems with the two tanks, contact Hollie Putnam* [hputnam@uri.edu](mailto:hputnam@uri.edu).

# Images of each scenario -

*The list of pipes/valves are as follows: Top and bottom for left and right sides (4 valves in total - 2 per side), a connecting pipe that is vertical between the two tanks, and the top horizontal pipe that feeds into the sump.*


**Completely closed ![no flow](https://github.com/rosiebailey/Putnam_Lab_Notebook_RB/blob/master/images/Water-Off.png)**
  - All pipes are perpendicular.

**Mixing salt water ![flow to salt water tank](https://github.com/rosiebailey/Putnam_Lab_Notebook_RB/blob/master/images/Mixing-SW.png)**
    - All pipes on the left (DI side) are perpendicular (off).
     *The top horizontal pipe should be off unless you are adding water to the sump.*
    - The vertical connecting pipe and top/bottom pipes on the right side (Salt Water side) are parallel (on).

**Adding Salt Water to Sump ![flow to sump](https://github.com/rosiebailey/Putnam_Lab_Notebook_RB/blob/master/images/Adding-SW.png)**
 - The bottom right (Salt Water side) is on (parallel) as well as the connecting pipe and the top horizontal pipe (pipe that feeds into sump).
 -  All other pipes are off. (Top on both sides and bottom left).

**Mixing DI water ![flow open to DI water tank](https://github.com/rosiebailey/Putnam_Lab_Notebook_RB/blob/master/images/Mixing-DI.png)**

- All pipes on the right (Salt Water side) are perpendicular (off). *The top horizontal pipe should be off unless you are adding water to the sump*
- The vertical connecting pipe and top/bottom pipes on the left side (DI side) are parallel (on).

**Adding DI water to sump ![flow to sump](https://github.com/rosiebailey/Putnam_Lab_Notebook_RB/blob/master/images/Adding-DI.png)**

- The bottom left (DI side) is on (parallel) as well as the connecting pipe and the top horizontal pipe (pipe that feeds into sump).
- All other pipes are off. (Top on both sides and bottom right).


## <left> Feeding-Coral <left/>
**Rinsing all equipment (with DI water) that will go in the water tables is essential for minimizing contaminants entering the water.**
*Feeding the corals in a gray tray outside of the water table helps to limit excess nutrients in the water table systems.*

1. Gather the food container, a small square container, and grey tray for feeding the corals. *These should all be together in the bottom drawer under the lab table.*
2. Rinse the square container in DI water and then add a few mL of tank water.
3. Add approximately 1/4 teaspoon (a full tube) of food to the small container that has water in it and mix it by gently shaking. *There is a small tube between the cap and the inner liner of the food container that will serve as a measurement guide.*
*You can use the inner liner as a scoop.*
4. Rinse the grey tray with ethanol and a kimwipe and then DI water and a kimwipe or paper towel.
5. Submerge the grey tray in the water table and carefully lift the egg tray and place in into the gray feeding tray.
6. Take the gray tray out of the water, **Making sure there is enough water to submerge the corals** and place it on the water table covers or on the desk/ lab table.
7. Wait *10-15 minutes* for coral to eat.
8. Place the coral back into the water table by gently lifting and shaking the egg tray. **This step is the most important because it helps to minimize introduction of excess nutrients in the water system.
9. Replace water table cover and dump out food contaminated water in gray tray in the sink or floor drain.
10. Rinse the grey tray in the sink and put all feeding equipment back in designated space.
