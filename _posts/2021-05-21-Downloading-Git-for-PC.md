### <center> Process of Downloading GitHub onto HP PC </center>

I have a windows 10 HP.
- Google search "Install GitHub PC Command Line"
- [Git Guides Install Tips](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git#:~:text=To%20install%20Git%2C%20navigate%20to,installation%20by%20typing%3A%20git%20version%20.)
- Click on link under "install Git for Windows" [Git for windows downloading page](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- Download the GitHub by clicking the "download" button. Make sure to open the application file when it is done downloading.
- You may have to open GitHub from your downloaded files on your computer multiple times to ensure you've downloaded GitHub and GitBASH.
- **Make sure to click on the box "Run" or "Launch" when the prompts pop up**
- Maggie's protocol for installing GitHub is linked here for the rest of the lab notebook set-up [Lab Notebook set-up](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/master/Lab_Resourses/Laboratory_Notebooks/Github-Notebook-Protocol.md)

## <left> Things that are not needed </left>
- PowerShell is automatically downloaded onto all PC's but won't be helpful unless extra add-ons are downloaded.
- Scoop will download onto PC's but won't help with the use of Atom or GitHub. I had trouble finding how to download and then trouble using the command line commands.  
- Homebrew isn't compatible for HP's or PC's.
