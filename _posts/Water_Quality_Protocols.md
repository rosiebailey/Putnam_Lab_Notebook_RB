### <center> Protocol for the Water Quality Tests in the WetLab </center>

This is the comparison between both the test protocols in The Wet Lab Manual and The CBLS Aquarium Room Water Quality Schedule and Protocols post by hgreich.
When comparing the two sets of protocols, both are similar and correct. The individual water tests with step-by-step instructions can be found further down in this document and in the Aquarium Room Protocols Post.
Consult the Wet Lab for PPE and Safety Protocols.
One big difference between the two sets of protocols is the water retrieval site, the Wet Lab instructs to pull water from the header tank and the Aquarium Room Protocol does not specify where the water should be tested from.

## <left> General Water Test Notes </left>
- Before beginning the water quality tests, be sure to obtain the waste bottles under the titration station from Lab room 190 in CBLS.
- Make sure to wear gloves and protective eye glasses/ goggles while performing all tests.
- If tests have been contaminated or too much reagent is added, dump test into designated waste conatiner, rinse with DI water, dump the rinse in the same waste container, and restart the test.

## <left> Equipment Protocol </left>
- **Do not put any test tubes into the water tanks**gather the water for testing with a clean container.  
- There are tests when equipment is inserted into the tank. This equipment includes, but is not limited to, the pH probe, the Salinity probe, the Light probe, the thermometer. **Before any equipment is placed into the tanks they need to be cleaned with DI water and a kimwipe**.
